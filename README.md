# Lemmy or Bono ?

"Lemmy or Bono ?"" is a funny little text-based commandline adventure game to determine whether you are a natural born rockstar (Lemmy) or basically just suck (Bono).<br>
I use this tiny project to experiment and play around with ruby. (*that's why this game is organized in a way more complex way than acually needed*)

To play the game, navigate into the `lemmy_or_bono` folder, run
```ruby
bundle install
```
to get the needed dependencies, and then
```ruby
rake play
```
to start the game via a raketask (*would not be nescessary, but whatever...*)
